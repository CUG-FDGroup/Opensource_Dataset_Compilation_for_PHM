### Bearings

#### FEMTO:
IEEE PHM 2012 Prognostic Challenge. The challenge is focused on prognostics of the remaining useful life (RUL) of bearings, a critical problem since most of failures of rotating machines are related to these components, strongly affecting availability, security and cost effectiveness of mechanical or power industries.

#### IMS:
Bearing run-tofailure tests were performed under normal load conditions on a specially designed test rig. The bearing test rig hosts four test bearings on one shaft. The shaft is driven by an AC motor and coupled by rub belts. The rotation speed was kept constant at 2000 rpm. A radial load of 6000 lbs. is added to the shaft and bearing by a spring mechanism
